# Quantum-Coin-Game

This is a small educational project, that can help understand a key difference of Quantum Computers and Classical Comuters. <br>
This is done by means of a simple game, that the User has a 50% chance of winning on a classical computer, when playing against teh computer. <br>
However, in a quantum computer, the user has a theoretically 0% chance of winning this game against the Quantum Computer. <br>
How? because a Quantum computer can exploit Superposition and maintain an algorithm that always makes it win the game, no matter what the user does. <br>

## Rules of the game:
1.This game has 2 players, the computer and you.<br>
2.The game consists of 7 moves, the first move by the computer and the next by you, and so on.<br>
3.The game starts with the coin in the Heads position. <br>
4.In each move, a player can either choose to flip the coin, or let it stay the same way.<br>
5.A player cannot see any moves done by the other player.<br>
6.None of the players can see the state of the coin during the game.<br>
7.The state of the coin is revealed after all the 7 moves.<br>
8.If in the end, the coin is Heads, then the computer wins. If it is tails, You win.

## A small note
The game is GUI based, using tkinter in python. However, it isn't perfect yet in the presentation. But it works fine. 
Still in beta for presentation. 


## Idea Credits
The credits for the idea of this game go to a TED video by Shohini Ghose, the link to which is attached below:<br>
