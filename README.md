# Quantum-Coin-Game

This is a small educational project, that can help understand a key difference of Quantum Computers and Classical Computers. <br>
This is done by means of a simple game, that the User has a 50% chance of winning on a classical computer, when playing against the computer. <br>
However, in a quantum computer, the user has a theoretically 0% chance of winning this game against the Quantum Computer. <br>
How? because a Quantum computer can exploit Superposition and maintain an algorithm that always makes it win the game, no matter what the user does. <br>

## Structure of the game:
1. The game has two levels : Level 1: Classical Coin Game, And Level 2: Quantum Coin Game level. <br>
2. In Level 1 , you play the game again a classical Computer with a classical Coin. <br>
3. In Level 2, you play the game against a Quantum Computer with a Quantum Coin. <br>
4. In both levels, the rules remain the same. <br>
5. You will have explored the entire game only once you have read the Final educational note about how the game works and can see the "Exit" button below it. This may take some retries, definitely in the Quantum Level. 

## Rules of the game:
1.This game has 2 players, the computer and you.<br>
2.The game consists of 7 moves, the first move by the computer and the next by you, and so on.<br>
3.The game starts with the coin in the Heads position. <br>
4.In each move, a player can either choose change the state of the coin, or let it stay the same way.<br>
5.A player cannot see any moves done by the other player.<br>
6.None of the players can see the state of the coin during the game.<br>
7.The state of the coin is revealed after all the 7 moves.<br>
8.If in the end, the coin is Heads, then the computer wins. If it is tails, You win.

## A small note
The game is in coded in python, using tkinter for GUI and IBM Qiskit for Quantum simulation.<br>
tkinter is a built-in module of python, however you'll have to download Qiskit to use the game. <br><br>

In case you are having problems in downloading Qiskit directly on your PC, you can use Jupyter Notebook to run the game. <br> 
1. Simply type !pip install qiskit on the first cell in a Jupyter notebook.
2. In the second cell type !pip install pylatexenc
3. Then copy the code from TheGame.py file into an empty cell in the notebook, and run the cell. <br>
